        All the world's a stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players;<br>
They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br>
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;<br>
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
And 'shining morning face', creeping like snail<br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
Sighing like furnace, with a 'woeful ballad'<br>
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,<br>
'Jealous in honor', sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
Seeking 'the bubble reputation'<br>
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,<br>
In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
